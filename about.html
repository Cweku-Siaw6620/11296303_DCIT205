    <h1 style="text-align: center; background-color: aqua;">WELCOME</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 17px;">This is the Data Innovation age and at its center is Software engineering. The investigation of software engineering is in this way 
        basic in the event that society is to make the most of the advantages Data Innovation brings to the table and make fast financial advances.
         Software engineering includes the review and improvement of utilizations that consider our ordinary utilization of PCs, the product frameworks
          that help these applications, and the means and techniques used to deliver the two applications and frameworks that act dependably, accurately 
          and morally. At the core of Software engineering lies the expertise of PC programming and businesses who recruit PC Researchers expect adroit software 
          engineers with information on flow strategies and apparatuses and the capacity to apply sound designing standards to the turn of events, development and 
          support of PC programs. <br><br>

        The scope of courses accessible in the division and the abilities gained by understudies empower them to track down work in numerous different fields of
         the economy and set up our alumni for the processing business, working in an undertaking group (or innovative work group), and to empower the alumni to 
         carry expert abilities to that group. The course additionally gives the stage to additional review or exploration through openness to laid out and arising 
         advancements and strategies, and to dynamic fields of examination in Software engineering.
        <br><br>
        The Division offers two college certificate programs, Four year certification in scientific studies in Software engineering Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and 
        Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Four year certification in scientific studies in Data Innovation.
